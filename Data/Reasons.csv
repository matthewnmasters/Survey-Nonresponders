Response
"After I completed the first survey pages and pages of questions and answers, I received a notification that you never received my answers, and then I never did any more."
"Ah, I had, um, a family member die, and I haven't been in the right frame of mind to do anything other than grieve."
"Ah, I just found the questions. Ah, too difficult to answer too specific as far as diet. And, um, I just didn't like the questions, I guess. Okay."
"Ah, change my mind decided not to participate."
"Ah, the time consuming. Ah, Requests for daily, uh, food diary. It's too time consuming."
Ah.
"As far as I know, I have completed the surveys. Um, I did get a email address change about a year ago, and this is my new email address. It is Jackson, my last name, Jackson dot family, the number five at a t t dot net again. 30 Jackson dot family and the number five."
"At first it was because I was lazy, period. They sat on my countertop unopened because I knew that it would take me a little while to finish them. Um, but about two weeks ago, I completed the surveys and drop them in the mail. So I know that they probably didn't meet your survey deadlines, but they should be on the way to you now."
"Basically, it's been a combination. Some of the surveys I have not received or if something was sent online. I just haven't had the time. But, uh, I definitely do want to continue to participate. Thank you."
Because I had cancer and I didnﾒt know he wanted me to be involved in this so I didnﾒt complete it.
"During that time, I lost my husband to cancer and I was trying to work. And then I retired. I sold my house and I moved. So I guess I lost interest in it and dealing with everything."
"Every time I've received a survey, I have submitted it and returned it."
"First off, there's the time constraint. Second off the fire destroyed our home and all possessions in it, including the survey form."
"First they're very winepress, right? What does the second say and keep doing wrong?"
Hackett extremely long a large package.
Hello.
"Hey, complete survey. Then I hadn't received any more, but I understand that over the years he answered like two."
"Hi, this is Carol. I'm sorry I completed your survey has been really sick. Um, I want to know if you want me to still complete them. Thanks. Bye."

Hold on, hold on. Um, Hold on, Fats. Rig Mr Part three"
"I I meant to complete them. Unfortunately, I had medical issues. Uh, and I It was a combination of, uh, forgetting and then, uh, having the time to complete them. So it was a combination of issues."
I I was too busy. I guess that means time and
"I I would say that they were complicated and because of life circumstances, I skipped one. And after that, it was hard to keep going again. So that was it."
"I am currently 72 as I was working on the surveys, uh, I got to the point that information that was being asked for had been so long ago, I I couldn't remember those dates, um, or time periods Well enough to answer the questions."
I am no longer interested in completing those. Please remove me from your list.
I am no longer interested in doing this.
I am not interested in doing it. Take me off of your list.
I am not part of the survey group.
"I became uninterested in it. I just didn't follow up. I changed jobs and, like I didn't want to do it."
I believe I completed them online. I That's what I recall. Maybe I'm wrong.
"I believe I sent it in, so I don't know. Um, I I was pretty sure I had sent it in, but maybe maybe I had it. I'm not sure."
"I believe I was contacted via email to complete the surveys. I'm not sure, but I think I was, um but I don't know, a pin number or a log in. So that's if if that's how the surveys are directed towards me, um, I I don't have the information to complete them. And when I called for information, I never was able to speak to a person, so I just gave up."
"I believe initially my log in did not work or I could not figure it out, and then I did not act on subsequent emails."
I believe it's too intrusive.
I believe that I have completed all surveys that were sent to me.
"I came down with breast cancer, and I've been having chemo, radiation and immunotherapy for almost three years."
"I can't do it online. And the paper ones are, um, just so time consuming."
"I can't find them. I misplaced them. And then I just kept forgetting that I could find them, that I had to do them, so I forgot about it."
"I can't remember what I wrote on the last survey, which means I can't be accurate on this last survey. And I, of course, never copied the previous survey, so I know how I'd answered."
"I changed my address, and I have never received the survey in the new address."
I changed my mind about doing it.
I chose not to participate in the study any longer.
I complete the for the second one. I didn't receive it. I wish I just I moved. Maybe you haven't Didn't have my others.
"I completed all of them, but the the last one and I was in a depression and just couldn't focus. And by the time I was able to focus on the survey, I received information saying that they didn't that it was completed that part."
"I completed all your surveys and send them back. So I don't know why you think I have not. So if if I missed one, then the mail lost it. But otherwise they've been all returned. Done."
"I completed and returned the surveys I received from the message and implies you never received any from me, which would be should be inaccurate. However, I have not received any in quite some time, probably because I moved."
I completed and submitted everyone submitted to me.
"I completed at least one extra survey. I thought I'd completed more. I don't know how often you send them, and therefore, I don't know how often I should be looking for them. But I know I have completed surveys in the past, and as far as I know, I have sent them back."
I completed everyone I
I completed many of them. I moved. There is one that I believe I received after and did not get to send that.
"I completed one survey that was sent to my house. I didn't receive any other surveys, but I did send back one."
"I completed the last one that was sent to me. My address is 6. 29 Walker Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21212 Happy to help you. Thanks for involving me."
I completed the survey and mailed it in within the last month.
I completed them and mailed them.
"I completed these surveys and mailed them in, Yeah."
I completed two out of the three surveys.
"I completed two previous surveys. The last one, perhaps the last two mailings I have not completed. They were during 2020. I work in a hospital. I did not have time, Covid. And I'm responding to your phone call now. That's it."
"I contracted ca breast cancer, and I didn't think I should be in the survey anymore."
"I could not figure out a way to accurately fill out the survey. The questions didn't seem to fit my lifestyle or work situation at all, so I could not answer accurately the questions, so I got frustrated and did not return the survey."
"I could not figure out how to enter into your database. I can't remember now, but I don't think I knew the password or somehow I just wasn't connecting, so I wasn't able to, um, enter the information."
I couldn't answer some of the questions.
"I couldn't complete them accurately because I had no way of knowing how much I'd eat various things. Oh, very six month time window. If I've been asked for things under a shorter time, such as the previous two weeks, I could have completed accurately the way the questions where, where it was impossible to do so correctly."
"I couldn't remember answers to some of the questions, and so I wasn't sure whether data that possibly was bad was worse than not answering."
I decided not to participate.
I decided to not this survey.
I did complaint them and mail them in.
I did complete a survey within the last two months and sent it in. It had been a long time that I had it in my possession.
"I did complete it, and I thought I sent it back in the mail."
"I did complete some surveys. Some I didn't complete. Where because I lost the paperwork or the paper was damaged. Before I could send it back, an online version would have helped to complete them."
"I did complete some that I received, but I do not remember the last time I've received any. I think, you know, they got lost in the mail or something, but I have not received any in a in a long time."
I did complete the survey.
I did complete the survey. I thought I sent it.
I did complete the surveys and mailed them back.
I did complete them and I did send them back.
I did complete them and I returned them. I'm not sure why you didn't get them.
I did complete them and sent them back. I don't know why you didn't get them.
"I did complete, but I think I missed on mailing it. And with covid, everything got delayed. Sorry about that."
"I did forget some, but I have changed addresses. Uh, I'm at 50 71. Abbots Glen way Northwest Georgia 30101 That's a B B, as in boy O t t as in Tom s Glen way."
"I did forget, but also I saw them to be long."
I did not have the time.
I did not have time. I've been extremely busy.
I did not realize that they were all that important. I thought it was just stuff coming through the mail.
"I did not receive but one survey and the one I received, I forgot to fill out."
"I did not see them. I'm not going to say they were never delivered. But I did not see them, so therefore I could not complete them."
I did not want to be in it anymore.
"I did not. I did Changed my mind And don't wanna participate, Period, Please take me off your no call my call. Your call is."
"I did repe reply to at least some of them, um, some on paper and some online. Not sure how many I missed, but would be happy to do them. Yeah."
I did return surveys to you. Never heard any word.
I did send them back.
"I did the first one and it was long, I mean, unbelievably long. So when the second one came, I had every intention of doing it. But my gosh, they don't all have to be so long. Or it could have a simple question. Has anything changed and that that could be a yes or no or what has changed? But no, I mean, it's all through everything. So I did the first one and that was it. And I don't mind doing them again, but they don't need to be so long every time. I mean, if it's like 10 questions, good, I'm out of here. But if it's like all the the, uh, the unbelievable amount of questions, I I don't have time for that. And I'd love to help, but I'm not I I don't have time to spend 30 minutes to an hour filling out a survey. Now I'll answer your questions over the phone if you want to do that. I don't mind answering a few questions every once in a while, but I'm not gonna sit there and go through that whole book again cause I did that the first time and I was happy to do it. I intend to do it again. Yeah. Is that all you needing"
"I didn't I didn't forget Sinochem. I must have, uh, misplaced them or something, because I send them out and I got the results back."
"I didn't complete the survey as some of the questions were so specific. I did not know how to answer them. The survey to complete Try to No, I understand into them properly."
I didn't feel I could give accurate information.
I didn't feel like I was making any difference.
I didn't feel like it. I didn't understand it.
I didn't have enough information to complete the medical portion and felt it was too long before my next appointment with my position.
I didn't have good memories of.
"I didn't have the time initially and then set them to the side. And then, uh, either misplaced them or just, uh, again didn't have the time to to get into them and get them completed."
I didn't have time there too long.
I didn't have time.
"I didn't have time. And then I switched my job, so I don't believe, um I was able to give a forwarding address to it, but initially I didn't have time."
"I didn't know I got any. Maybe I did, but I don't remember."
"I didn't know if they were really that important to you guys. If you really needed me to do it or not, or if this was just like I just wasn't sure of the value behind me, um, investing the 20 minutes or whatever it is to complete them."
I didn't know the answers to the questions.
I didn't know what they were.
I didn't make the time to do the surveys.
I didn't really think that I was making much contribution.
"I didn't think I qualified for it, because when they went to do the blood draw, they were not able to draw my blood because I was pregnant and it was warm out and my veins were dehydrated. They were not able to pull blood out, so I didn't think there was a need to do it."
"I didn't think that my answers were honest because some of the questions were very specific. Ah, example. How much time did I spend in the sun during my twenties or my thirties? And I honestly didn't think that I could give you accurate information and I was making it up, and I don't think it was truthful. So that's why I decided my contribution would not be accurate for the study."
I do not care to fill them out any longer. Please stop sending them.
I do not know their additional surveys. I thought it was only a one time thing.
"I do not want to participate anymore. I have not had cancer, but I simply do not want to participate anymore."
I do not want to participate.
I do not wish to participate in the survey.
I do not wish to participate in this study anymore.
"I don't believe I received them, but I also had a major brain surgery which has required, um, a lot of rehabilitation, and it was a lengthy ordeal."
"I don't believe I've received one in a while. Um, when my kids were younger, I think I just didn't have the time. But I would love to fill one out if you send me a new one."
I don't care to participate in the survey any longer. Please take me off your list.
I don't feel like the surveys are beneficial to fighting cancer.
I don't feel there's a need anymore because I just have none of the symptoms and it isn't in my family and it's very repetitive and it's very long.
I don't have glasses. I need trifocals. I don't have the money. I've been taken by people from cars that I've bought and therefore I I have no money to get these glasses by having to sit there and read a survey and check things off. My eye hand coordination is off because I do not have both eyes with the same vision when I is totally different and getting worse. And there's nothing I can do at this time to be able to go and get the eyes checked to be able to purchase trifocals. So I have problems with having to do an abundance of paperwork.
I don't have the time to invest in these surveys.
"I don't know what 50 is. Are you talking to me? No, no, no. What is he doing? Mmm, mmm. Mmm."
I don't recall receiving them.
"I don't remember a lot of things, so I don't know if I did it right."
I don't remember my number.
I don't understand the words.
I don't want to any longer.
I don't want to be involved anymore.
I don't want to no longer want to be involved.
I don't want to participate anymore.
I don't want to.
I don't wish to participate.
I ended up getting cancer anyway.
"I felt dissed from the cancer society when I when I actually got cancer, and I called them to let them know that I would be dropping out of there. Um, study. And everybody just seemed, uh, nonchalant about it. And I just thought, You know what? I'm not giving you people the time of day. I've gone through this whole situation by myself and not one help from anybody from your cancer society. So you know what? I'm done."
"I felt kind of overwhelmed by them. There were things that were I couldn't remember. They were from so long ago, and so I would put them aside to go back to them again, and then sometimes I would forget about it."
I felt the questions. We're getting a little too personal.
"I felt they were very long involved and that I probably wasn't able to remember back, as far as I needed to remember to complete them and also to have the detail that you needed for them."
"I find that that you repeatedly asked me questions that I can no longer remember. You're going to ask me what my weight losses were in the last 10 years. I'm not going to remember that stuff. Um, yeah. You ask too many questions that require too much history if you want something. But then last year I can do that before that. Forget it."
I find the packets are too big.
I forgot and lost the document.
"I forgot them, period. I set them aside."
I forgot to do it.
I forgot.
I forgot. I forgot. I forgot.
"I forgot. I just honestly, uh, probably put it aside to do later and then just slipped my mind."
I forgot. Yeah.
I found it very difficult to answer the questions accurately for the first survey.
I found the surveys cumbersome and very long and time consuming to complete as a working individual working anywhere from 40 to 60 hours a week. It should not take me 30 minutes to try to complete a survey.
"I get the impression from the question surveys that I'm missing more than one. And I know that I completed, um, a couple, but they were late. Um, and I caught. I may possibly I didn't, um But I would be happy to continue with this study and and possibly an online submission would be better. Um, but feel free to either email me or mail me. And I think you have my current email M p for Paula B B B i B B y at a t t dot net email address. And my home address is the same. So I will be happy to, uh, to answer any questions. Thank you."
"I got busy and just didn't, uh, finish them. I figured when I missed one, you guys would not want the rest of them done. I think I've missed, uh, three now, is that right?"
I got divorced and moved. I never got another C P three study after I left my original address.
"I got hung up initially with a lot of the his history and, you know, historical questions that I didn't know the answer to. And I didn't. It didn't seem like there was an option to not answer them. So then, like I said, I got behind from the beginning. And then, um, I just never It was then I just kind of I was frustrated and never, never finish them. And I feel terrible, but it was it just it was started taking too much time to try to figure out what some of the answers were, um, things I didn't remember from years ago. So, um and then I just never continued once I got stuck. So that's it."
I got married again. My name now is Kenley instead of parishes. K i n l E Y.
I got my papers wet. I was flooded with water.
"I got some polls, some hurt her and others forgot. However, I have not received the survey every year."
"I got the package. Ah, and it was looked like it would take a lot of time. So I set it aside, and then I Months later, when I remembered them, I you know this This was each survey they sent months later. I was like I just didn't feel like sending them back. It seemed like it was too late."
"I got the second survey, and I filled it out almost completely. And there was one question that I wasn't sure how to answer. It was about time of exposure to the sun, I think. And I was trying to really think about, like, all all of the time that it added up. And I eventually, uh, put it aside and didn't get back to it. And then I got the second, uh, copy of it. And I didn't fill that up because I already filled out the first one, and, uh, I I just put it on the back burner and then get back to it. Uh, eventually, I moved and threw away the survey that I completed. And then I got the third survey at some point. And because I haven't filled out the second survey, I didn't"
I got them in the email and then I I forgot because the email was already read to go back to it.
"I had a family issues that kept me from doing pretty much anything. I was very depressed and I just couldn't do it. It was too long and too in depth, and I just couldn't do it. Sorry."
"I had a few deaths in the family, and I myself had a terrible accident."
"I had a roommate that was going through my mail, and he was just He trashed a lot of my stuff, so I kind of got behind on bills and apparently the surveys. I never received them because of him. He's no longer living with me. Um, so I can restart this surveys, if I can."
"I had a some medical problems and I had a brain aneurism. And, uh, I I got too involved with helping helping with my parents and taking care of them with their doctor's appointments. And I have been wanting to continue the paperwork, but I having a lot of time keeping up with everything I need to be doing. I I am also being tested for possible cancer. Are you still there? I'm gonna hang up if you don't say something."
"I had bariatric surgery, comma a sleeve Death directed me in 2017, and I thought that it might have a great impact on the dietary results."
"I had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, and I did notify the survey, but also it could be that I didn't receive the package is because I have since moved from the location that I initially had started the, uh, program with Yeah."
"I had difficulty completing the survey online. When I was not able to complete one survey online, I thought that it would be No, it would be. Do you no good for me to try to complete subsequent surveys? Um, so I just stopped responding. And, uh, that's the reason I I was what intent My intent was to stay and continue to do those, um, surveys and participate in that study as long as necessary. And, um, when I got hung up on the online part of it and trying to navigate, um, that was I couldn't find a way around it. So, um, I was not able to complete a survey. And then, um, I had I felt like I needed to drop out."
I had no time.
"I had relocated to another state, and my time was did not allow me to complete it. And I didn't think because I was in another state that that would apply."
"I had two parents in critical health. Um, in the past year and a half."
I have a hand problem and I cannot can no longer white with my hands. I can't hold a pen to write on the surveys. I feel really bad because I really wanted to do this.
I have already lost love two loved ones in my family from a cancer.
"I have been dealing with other non cancer medical issues, including multiple knee surgeries, and I've had, uh, some other major health issues that have required my time and attention and made it difficult to follow the protocol of your study."
"I have been out of town and hospitalized, no cancer."
I have been taken care of. My 91 year old mother and I have not had time.
"I have been the primary caretaker for two elderly parents, one of which has passed away and have not focused on anything other than their care."
I have cancer.
I have completed all of the surveys.
I have completed all survey sent to me and I have returned all surveys sent to me. I'm not sure why you have me listed as not completing them. I have done every single survey that I have received this far.
I have completed all the surveys. The last survey. It took me over a year to complete. I sent it in in 2020. It was completed.
"I have completed some surveys. I did have a move in August, so there's been a recent survey. Um, I do have a new address."
"I have completed some surveys. Uh, but they were submitted late. Probably, uh, just, uh, occupied with other things. Uh, you know, I regret not having done them on time."
I have completed the surveys and has mailed them back.
"I have completed the surveys. The last one I believe, may have then after the deadline, but sure did complete the paper survey and returned."
I have completed them and mailed them in. Not sure why you haven't gotten them? Yeah.
"I have completed them and, uh, sent them hard. Copy. Um, so perhaps they either never got mailed, or, uh, I'm not sure what may have happened, but I have completed them."
I have completed your surveys and I mailed them back. I don't know what happened to him from there.
"I have completed your surveys, so I don't know why I'm receiving this call telling me that I have not completed them."
"I have completed, I believe two, possibly three surveys. So if I'm missing one, um, and I completed those online, so if I'm missing one, I'd certainly be happy to fill that out."
"I have completed, I think two surveys and the last one, I just hadn't had the time."
"I have completed, Um, all the surveys, Except for I think, the last one. I haven't an email, and I just haven't made the time to do it, But I have done one and two. Yeah."
I have developed a extreme dislike for questionnaire.
I have elected not to participate.
I have electronically and submitted the survey via paper at least three times over the years.
"I have filled them out, put them in the envelope and mailed them back to you."
"I have had a lot of death in my life in the last few years. Uh, mostly cancer related. And I felt that I didn't remember enough to in the first set of questions to, um, answer correctly, I felt like I was being evaluated. I don't know why. Um, I'm really good at talking. Uh, so if someone wants to fill it out for me and talk to me, that would be fine. 8453993886"
I have moved and I had health issues not related to cancer.
I have moved and they have gotten lost when I have moved.
"I have moved over the past, um, couple years. And so I'm just not sure that my address has been updated for you guys to, um, contact me, but that's the main reason."
I have moved residents and lost them in the move.
I have moved several times and I haven't been receiving.
"I have moved since I originally started as well as I now work full time before I was not employed. I am now married and I have four Children. I am a full time R n so I believe I've completed some of them, but I probably have not gotten all of them."
"I have moved, never received them."
I have moved.
"I have never completed one of them since I left the hospital, simply because of the fact of time and what it takes to sit down and actually do that when you have four kids and two jobs."
I have no idea Why didn't complete them. Bye.
I have no idea what surveys were four and why you were sending them to me. And I'd like you to just continue taking or take me off the list and just continue calling or sending me anything. Thank you.
I have no interest in doing the surveys. I wish for you to remove me from your active database. Please do not call or send me anything in the future. Thank you.
"I have no valid reason for not having done so. Um, at one point I picked them back up, and it was months after I received them, so I decided it was probably too late to send it. If it's not too late, I would be happy if you would resend these. I would be happy to. We we, uh, turn them to you."
"I have not completed the surveys because I just wanted to drop out of that Ah survey. And so I just didn't complete anything, so I just did not want to participate any longer. Thank you."
I have not had enough time to do so.
I have not seen this survey this week. I have been on vacation.
"I have received. I have completed some of the service in the past and mailed it. Secondly, I have moved. I have moved. So I have a new address. Now. I am in Raleigh, North Carolina. I'm normal in Greenville, North Carolina. So, um, my new address is 21. 01 Ventana Lane. I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina, and the Zip is 27604"
I have relocated and have a new home address. That's probably why I didn't receive the surveys. I'd like to update my address.
I have retired.
I have severe fibromyalgia. I'm in pain a lot. I just don't feel like dealing with it.
I have to a different address.
"I have, uh, privacy issues with, um, with all the medical questions. I fear that, uh, it can be used against me later by an insurance company. Even though I realized that the data is supposedly, um uh, anonymized for for lack of a better term. But it still is a concern for me. That's why I didn't do it."
I have. I responded online.
"I haven't completed some of the surveys because of the questions. Uh, I'd ask questions about when I first got my period, and I don't remember a lot of that information. So it makes me makes it hard for me to move to the next question without answering the easiest question."
"I haven't received any lately. Um, so I'm not sure. I know I started completing them, but, um, like I said, I haven't received any recently. Um, I don't recall getting any in the past year or so."
"I haven't received notification, okay?"
"I haven't received them because we moved, and apparently you haven't gotten change of address."
"I initially was going to complete them. And then I forgot because during the times that they were coming, I was totally overwhelmed with various things happening, including being diagnosed with cancer and treatment and many other medical issues myself. Like the lateral operation in this case, the two by for in the configuration. What? Yeah."
"I just It was too much information being asked at the time, and it just was way too much going on in my world and I did not have time to track all the information that you all wanted to be tracked."
I just decided I'm not interested.
I just decided not to be a participant.
I just decided that I didn't want to do it.
I just didn't feel the need to do it at the time.
"I just didn't get the time to do it, so I feel badly about that. I should have done it, but I just didn't get it done. I apologies."
I just didn't take the time to do it. I should have and I will complete them from now on.
"I just felt like that. There's more to whatever. The underlying reason was that the studies being done and I don't really feel comfortable with giving out my personal health information anymore, okay?"
"I just felt like they're very cumbersome and cover too much ground, period. I would have preferred if it, uh, have more basic questions that could be answered more quickly."
I just forgot to fill out the forms and send them in.
I just got lazy and decided I didn't want to be part of the study.
"I just have not, uh, following up on them and have the time to do that."
I just haven't had the time to do it. Bye. Yeah.
I just haven't had the time to sit down and do it.
I just haven't taken the time to get it done.
I lost interest in complaining service.
I lost interest.
I lost my job. I didn't have time busy.
"I mailed the last survey back, um, months ago. Last late last year? Probably. Um, or mid year late last year. Um, so I had misplaced. I forgot to mail it, but I did mail it back to you."
"I moved a few times and missed, placed the forms."
"I moved a lot since I initially enrolled in the study, and I don't think my mail has been able to catch up with me."
"I moved about two years ago, and I haven't received one since, okay?"
"I moved and I forgot to take my address. And I may have gotten them, but I forgot. Sorry."
I moved and did not receive them.
I moved and didn't give you my new address.
I moved and didn't receive them.
I moved and they were not forwarded to me.
I moved from residence.
I moved from the country of Puerto Rico. I now live in the United States.
I moved in. I haven't received surveys since I moved.
I moved out of the area and have not received the survey.
I moved three times across the country and within the same state started three different positions and I did not have the time.
"I moved to the United States, change my address."
"I moved, and I'm not sure if you guys have the new address on file."
I moved.
"I need to speak to a person, please."
"I needed information from my, uh, doctors office about the additional cancers that I've had since the initial survey. I have that now."
"I never had a chance, er."
I never had cancer of any kind.
I never received them because I moved states and did not know how to change my address.
I never received them because I moved.
I never volunteered for your surveys. Please take me off your list and please do not call again.
I only received one additional survey which I did complete and returned.
I prefer email.
"I probably just haven't gotten around to it. It maybe it didn't seem like I had enough priority along with other stuff I had going on. Um, I know I should have responded. I guess I might be willing now. Although it could be hard. Uh, but maybe just kind of, uh, it's just kind of cutting left and hasn't gotten done. I think I've got some of them one or two of them in a stack, some place, and I just haven't gotten around to dealing with them."
I really didn't know what they were. I don't remember signing up for any survey. Sorry.
"I received one, and I did complete it, and I sent it back in the mail. So if you have not received it, I would check with the post office. Um, that was the only survey I received. I have not received any other besides the one and I don't know which one it would be, since I only received one."
"I received one. Um, I changed jobs and my email address probably changed. We also moved, uh, to another city. So my correct email address is J. M. Bassam at gmail dot com. My new address is 623 Ansley Way, Allen, Texas 75013 Just send me another survey. I will complete it. Thank you. Okay."
"I received, but I haven't received any lately. The first one I filled out and sent back. And then I now have cancer, and I called and discuss that with the Secretary and I have not received anything since then."
I retired and haven't been and had been moving around places and don't always get my mail.
"I saw a very limited value in continuing, so I stopped."
"I signed up for the surveys when I lived in Ohio, and three years ago I moved to New York City. And so I have a new address, and I haven't received any surveys. Uh, since moving to New York."
I simply decided I didn't want to participate anymore.
"I sought. After the first one, I was disqualified. For some reason, I can't remember back that far, but, um, so I just threw everything else away."
"I started a new business, and so my time was limited. I'd be happy to complete them, especially if I could do it online."
"I started completing it. I guess I should have said time. But it was way longer than I expected and more involved than I expected, so I didn't complete it."
"I started filling them out, and as they went on, they became just too intrusive. And I decided that, um, I would no longer participate."
"I started smoking again, so my circumstances changed."
"I started to complete them, but I didn't have all the information that was asked about, uh, in particular. They were. Medical results are tests that had not been done. And I thought that I could, um, be a doctor and get those results and then complete them. But I never did and forgot. I wasn't sure if I should just turn it in in complete."
"I tested positive for Bracket too, and I've had a mastectomy, so I don't think I would be a good candidate for your survey."
"I think I was just very busy and had competing priorities. And they were so long, Um, I just never got around to it."
"I think I've completed them all and sent them back in the return envelope that you guys provided. Um, there would have been a delay, but I think I had sent them all back, so you should have them."
"I think in general it was a time challenge of Oh, my goodness. I've got to get to this. So it might be considered Category two forgot, but it was more about time to set aside the time to complete it. Um, I think would have been easier done either electronically or through a phone survey like this."
"I think that there was a, um, password at one time and because there was a time, um, lots of time in between. When those surveys arrived, I lost the password and for some reason, could not reset it."
"I think the surveys were are very important. But I had a traumatic brain injury with bleeding on my brain. I would send me in a totally different, um, direction. It was a double concussion I had at the same incident. And, uh, that's the only reason why, but, um, in the future, I would like to participate if we if you have another one, cause I am better. I'm better able to, uh, complete a survey."
I thought I had completed all the surveys we got.
"I thought I had returned the last couple I received, Um, although it was a little bit light. Um, I need to go online, I guess. And see if there are some online surveys. Or if you could email me a link to the survey that you need completed, I'll be happy to do that. My email is Betsy dot whitfield at gmail dot com b e t s y dot w h i t f i E l d at gmail dot com and I'll get those completed this weekend. Thank you."
I thought I sent one long one in and have not received any further.
I thought it was completed and sent back my apologies.
I thought it was kicked out of the survey. I thought it was kicked out of the
I thought that I did complete your surveys until I got cancer myself and notified the team.
"I thought the survey was cumbersome. It asked questions that I possibly couldn't remember back to my childhood, how I ate, what vegetables I ate. I think I missed the mark in what I was trying to do."
"I thought the surveys that I received I completed and sent in. I thought you had them. The ones I got, I sent it."
"I thought there was a date by which it had to be completed and I did not make that date, so I didn't realize I could complete it and send it back in. I apologize."
"I tried filling out the survey online and it said it was closed, so I threw out the paper versions of them, and I wish there was a way that your survey here on the phone would deal with the fact that I'm in the middle of making dinner and doesn't give me an option to delay this until another time."
"I tried to set it up originally online, and I kept getting a spam notice and a virus notice on my computer so I wouldn't go any further, afraid I'd get a virus on my computer. Then I started getting them in the mail, and it had been so long since I filled one out. I didn't figure they'd be valid anyway."
I understand they're sending it to a previous address and they don't have my new mailing address.
I want to know why y'all send them to me. I don't have cancer.
I want to withdraw from the survey.
I wanted to do it online and it would not let me for some reason.
"I was a an employee at Saint Joe's when this started. I am no longer employees, okay?"
I was a change of direction. I moved to the United States.
"I was always away and in Puerto Rico with my mother and, um traveling back and forth from New York to Puerto Rico."
I was diagnosed with cancer and I was I called and talked to somebody and they told me that I would not be in this study anymore. That is why I have not filled out the surveys.
I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in September of 2019. I'm still receiving treatment.
"I was going to volunteer for the survey, and when I went to get my blood work, they could not get the blood. This has been, like maybe 4.5 5 years ago, so I've never received anything. I'm not part of the survey I wanted to be. I gave all my information, and then they couldn't draw any blood, so I couldn't do it."
I was helping my mother battled cancer and then she passed.
I was homeless and now recently have a new residence.
I was in America.
"I was in the process of taking care of two sick parents, and then I got a divorce and I have them. I didn't fill it out. I'm sorry."
I was living overseas.
I was medically ill and retired and just forgot after that.
I was never able to get on the site to complete.
I was on a trip.
I was out of the country for a period of time. I'm back now and willing to continue in future studies.
I was out of the country.
I was sick and I moved to another stage.
I was sick and unable to respond.
"I was supposed to be able to do it online, and it never allowed me to do it online."
"I was taking care of my oldest sister, who has dementia and was moved to Florida."
I was told that I was not part of the study because they didn't get a sufficient amount of blood during the blood would drive.
"I was told that I was removed from the survey because they did find a nodule, a small one. But, um uh, I'm in a doctor's care, and that's why I haven't completed him. I didn't think I'd have to after I was told I was removed from the survey."
"I was trying to be accurate, and it got to this part where it was all about supplements and how much I took and how often. And I wasn't very, ah, routine about it. Like sometimes I took. Sometimes I didn't. This is a while back. Inaccurate. Mm. I'd rather just not I I figured no info is better than inaccurate. So, um, at that time, I was taking a bunch of supplements and, um, I I was also going through some other stuff, and it just seemed overwhelming. Ah, also, I've moved. I don't know if, um ah. Recently, the last year and a half, I moved and and I've had two surgeries. I don't know if I've even gotten any here or not."
I wasn't sure if it was junk meal.
"I would I would complete them. But they I actually think all the emails are going to, um my junk email file. So I never saw the the actual surveys, but I would be willing to take them again."
I would like to be removed from the survey.
I would rather not say.
I'd like to opt out.
I'd like to understand how the information is being saved and used.
I'd rather not.
"I'm currently taking care of two grandchildren, and I just don't have the opportunity to sit down and do this right now, so I'm very sorry."
"I'm her husband. She passed away April 25th. I'd like to speak to someone, a person, an actual person, not a recording."
I'm here because it was in my car and they never did it because I'm an idiot.
"I'm leaving peacefully and think I'm great. Thank you. Said it said it four times. Now I got it. You see what I have to deal with? Um, it's almost a good thing I got fired before. I, you know, freaking punch him in the face. I got arrested for assault anyway. Um, yeah, let's go ahead and wrap this up because I'm gonna be pretty pretty. Oh, my God. How many people were complaining? What are you trying to accomplish? What are you trying to accomplish? Take your lunch break? Because I work. I work through every lunch break I've ever had. What are you trying to accomplish right now? Absolutely. Okay, Because you never Okay. All right, I got it. And what? What is What is this accomplishing right now? Because there's a third. I've been packing for half an hour and you keep coming back and interrupting. I would have been gone by now. This bullshit. I got it. Thank you. You want to send me a letter with all the information and laminate it? Okay, I'm gonna I'm taking Hang on a second. I'm taking my belongings. You can scrub this. You can. You can take your own toothbrush and clean that thing. Yeah, Got it. Thank you. Got it. Thanks. I'm out. I'm almost done. Got it."
I'm no longer interested in being in the survey. I've had skin cancer. I thought that disqualified me.
I'm no longer participating.
"I'm not interested anymore. I've moved, and, um, I don't have the incentive to do it anymore."
I'm not interested in being part of the survey anymore.
I'm not interested in participating in the program any longer.
I'm not interested.
"I'm not into doing surveys and that kind of thing, and I don't do these telephone things, and I don't want to hang up on you again, but I'd like to hang up, okay?"
I'm not sure if I ever got a survey.
"I'm not sure if I receive them or didn't receive them. I've moved since I started this. The survey, Um and I think that's about it. I and I kind of forgot, so it's a combination of everything."
"I'm not sure. I just I don't think I received them, but maybe I did and didn't get them them or I forgot to do them."
"I'm sorry that I didn't complete the surveys. There was a lot going on in my life with the death of my mother. And I had two surgeries, um, and a gamma knife procedure. And I was feeling overwhelmed. I also was concerned on the form about having to remember when I had certain surgeries or things that happened that I have no recollection of and I got very frustrated there also."
"I'm taking alternative health treatments, so I don't, uh, not interested in the survey. Thank you."
I'm too busy taking care of my husband with his health problems.
"I've I've got I had cancer, prostate cancer, and I figured I'd no longer belong to this survey. So therefore, I did not fill out the survey."
"I've been a single mother and work constantly, and on my days off I didn't want to sit down for 30 minutes and fill out a questionnaire."
I've been busy. We were fostering Children. That's it. Please resend them.
I've been deployed overseas on a ship multiple times and require a lot of travel in the performance of my job.
"I've been diagnosed with a Meloy doses, which is a hereditary disease, and, uh, severely affects my health. So I guessing that any results that I would report would be skewed by the fact that I'm not suffering from cancer, but rather from, uh, another, uh, life threatening disease."
I've been going through a divorce.
I've been ill.
"I've been moving from state to state and I finally have gotten settled. I actually have moved three times and and in the last six years, and so it's It's been a little hectic, but I'm finally settled. And, uh, then I had heart surgery, and, um so I I'm sorry. I, um I'm I've been meaning to fill out the surveys, and I just haven't done it. I I apologize for not completing my part of the program."
I've been really six for the past few years is the reason why I have not completed the surveys period.
"I've been, um, feeling back, so I haven't had the time feeling bad."
"I've completed all the surveys I've been sent, including one within the last year. I'm confused. Why You don't have them? I've sent them each back in their own pre address envelopes. Perhaps you have me listed in the study twice under two different names or something else is different. I'm not sure why."
I've completed the surveys that I've received and return them. I don't know why you have records that I haven't.
I've decided not to participate.
"I've had different positions, therefore different health insurance. And I was not up to date with what was going on. Like pass me results. Um, lab. So I thought I was not giving full information."
"I've moved out of the area. Um, I lived in California now I'm in Arizona, and apparently they were not forwarded to me, and I never received the survey."
I've moved. Maybe they've gone to a different address.
I've not had time.
"I've probably moved since. That'll address that y'all have on me. The new address is 38 Milken Lane, Alabama 36203 And I really just forgot about I think I know I've got one. Uh, anyway,"
"I've received some of the surveys in the mail, and I did, but I have not received any in, uh, for a long time. That's why I've not received, uh, did any more surveys."
"I've received them. I just, uh, haven't made the time to complete them. It is something I'm interested in doing. Um, I would not be opposed to, uh, receiving, um a a repeat, uh, mailing, Um, and, uh, I I tend to misplace things from time to time."
"I, uh, have not completed any of the surveys because, uh, I'd always received them in the mail. Um, I'm a a digital sort of person. Everything is is on email. And so it was very difficult process wise to get that into my workflow. I have it on my to do. They would just build up. They would I would forget. And so, uh, what would make it a lot easier and faster is if I received an email, uh, with, uh, a form and I could very quickly and easily, uh, fill that out from my email. Um, that would be much, much better than getting something in the U. S. Mail."
"I, um, was released by my doctor because, uh, there was no more, uh, active lesions. And the doctor said that I did not need to come back any longer for five years. So, um, I have gone back in, uh, for, uh, check up, uh, recently and again. I was released for another five years, so I have no cancer activity, no positive cancer activity."
"In May of 2019, I was involved in a serious bicycle accidents. When I fell off my bicycle, I went through ventricular fibrillation. Had a heart attack. Luckily, uh, they got to me within two minutes. I was in a coma for a week, and I spent the summer of 2019 going through cardiac rehabilitation. I went back to work October 1st. Unfortunately, uh, I do have an A history of urinary bladder cancer having trunk contaminated water. And when I was in the Marines and I had to go through, um, uh, urinary arthroscopic surgery, and I had, um, a prostate cancer. Also, that was, uh, diagnosed and so far has been treated. And, um, I also had a sampling of recent, um, skin cancer, Uh, not melanoma, just based wholesale. So that's that's the reason I haven't responded to the surveys."
"It is not for lack of wanting to, but is a lack of being able to focus long enough and to keep it at top dead center on my table to do it. The problem is called a D D. And, uh, I fight it in every aspect of my existence. I want to participate. I want to answer the questions."
"It was a problem of quantifying to break down into daily increments the activities that might be once weekly or twice weekly. I feel it's very, very important."
"It was difficult to remember, um, when you got far back into your childhood or years and years ago. I mean, I'm in my seventies, and I just don't remember a lot of the things that you asked me. So rather than just put down anything instead of what you're trying to get, is honest answers. I just decided not to do it. Plus, my husband got cancer."
It was very long and very repetitious of the same questions that I had previously answered.
"It's basic procrastination. I I get them, put them to the side with a reminder to do them and then time just passes. So it's not lack of time. It's time management."
"It's just too difficult. I mean it. It asks. Ah, you know what you're eating? What? Uh, I don't know. I filled out a couple of them, but, um then my whole my whole life changed, and I no longer was being healthy, so I didn't want to put that down just so many things. So, uh, I just I just didn't think it could be accurate. I I didn't know. I didn't know how to measure my my exercise and and all that stuff. It just wasn't the same anymore, so I couldn't do it."
It's like doing four hours of homework. I don't have time to do all that. It's too long.
It's too hard to answer the questions of how many cups of whatever it is I've eaten. I've eaten itemizing. Just what I'm eating has been too difficult.
Just complete and mailed it.
"Leave me alone, period. Stop sending me stuff, period. Stop calling me."
"Many of the questions are from quite a while ago, and I don't know the answers to that. And I don't. You know what I would have answered to begin with? Um, so I didn't answer. I didn't want to do the new, um, studies because I'm not I don't want to give you information that isn't the same as what I had given you to begin with."
Mira guide.
Mm. I do believe that I've received two surveys and completed them and send them back in. And those are the only two that I received. Thank you.
My email has changed. Yeah.
"My father had mental selling Soma and I was stuck trying to fill out part of the form, and I put it off to the side and I didn't get back to it. So I have get filled out from the first one you gave me from right when you gave it to me and I could fill out one of the new ones, but I just haven't done it. Sorry."
"My husband died of brain cancer very shortly after this process began. When I received the first survey, I was too distraught to completed, and I thought since I didn't do the first one, I shouldn't do anymore."
"My husband was ill with cancer, and it was a long journey. Um, so it was a long three or four years, so and he has since passed, so"
"My husband was in a bad motorcycle accident and I was his main caregiver and he passed away just, um, two years ago."
"My last name is not tailor. My last name is, uh, last name. And so I have been concerned or soon that this was something slow."
"My mother was very ill for several years, and I was, uh, even though she was in facility, I was pretty much there every evening. She had to be fed, and I had to keep an eye on things. So I just didn't feel like I had the time in the energy to, uh, fill out these surveys."
"My understanding was, if the survey knew that I had cancer, I would not be notified. I would just be allowed to continue on. I don't agree with that."
"My workload was heavy with work. Um, I had a young family, Uh, and I was doing a lot of work on my house, which took a lot of time. Plus, uh, just didn't have time to fit it in. Sorry."
Oh!
"Oh, I completed the first one, and then I didn't do the rest because I assumed it was the same. It looked like the same set of questions, so I didn't, uh, do the rest."
"Oh, I did receive them. They got destroyed in, uh, some water damage I had, so I didn't still didn't tell them out."
"Oh, fuck."
"Oh, just too much going on in life. Uh, I moved in 2018 out of state. Uh, I don't recall if I've received anything in the mail of my new address or not and just been extremely busy."
"Oh, starting now. Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know. I was working at Vanderbilt when the study happened. I was excited. I signed up, I donated blood and then I just I don't know. I got busy. And then I moved, and I just dropped it. And it's just laziness, I guess on my part, and I apologize."
"Oh, then they're hurricane. Earthquake. Okay, Ur. You're done with remote labor issues."
"Okay, Okay. For how long you've been having this problem is before Read this raccoon coming in and out of here. Okay, Hold on one second. I don't Don't tell me why you didn't put you on your request. That is a freaking snake. I don't Yeah, you should have sent somebody else. I Yes, Yeah, whatever. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, no problem.

Holy shit. Okay, listen, I I don't deal with I don't like freaking snakes. I have that fear. When I was like a like, you know, when I was a kid, I got bitten by the snake and almost die. So I have that fear. So every single time when we get request for, like, you know, snakes for for any kind of snakes I will send my partner. Right? So right now, this idiot, she called me, he said, and he told me that something is moving. Probably. Idiot. There is not like, if you cannot don't make so much noise, they eat. And the chef. Thank you. Yeah, that's easy. So, um Okay. Uh, okay. Would you mind to hold my cell phone? Okay. Okay. You know what you might want to do? You might wanna, um, just reaching the top there and close the drain. If he was coming in and out of that, I didn't want to reach in because I don't do snakes. But if you just close it, just reach in. If you just Do you want by, you just put your hand right next to the thing and and, um yeah, just drink so you can get out again. Okay, Hold on a second. Okay? I'll stay with me. I just let me take care of this bullshit, and you can You can tell me everything with you one for me. And how can I help? Okay. Okay. Just hold on.

We have five stars on Yelp. We we know what we do. Oh, my God. I'm so freaking out right now. I'm getting sweaty. I'm getting stinky when I sweat, I think I hate snakes. So anyways, um, you can I listen? I know it will be better if you can call me tomorrow, but I would like to handle this."
"Okay, The question list is too long and goes into way too much history."
"Okay. I was told that, um they didn't have that survey anymore in Lexington. I couldn't be a part of it. So I didn't see any sense in completing it because I didn't know how it would be further tested End."
Okay. See? Too many. Long In the goddess.
"Okay. Um well, I typically like to complete them online. And the first survey may be, too. I was able to go online to complete them, and then the ones after that, I did not see any option to go online. And I'm far too busy to, you know, fill out a piece of paper. You know, like a booklet full of questions. Um, it's a lot easier online. And also, uh, you just stop sending them to me. I got, like, the first two, maybe the third. And then you quit sending the surveys to me, that's why done."
"Shortly after I signed up for the survey, my husband died suddenly from stomach cancer. And I am full time caregiver from my mother who had moved in with me 11 months prior to that, I had to, um I resigned my nursing position and to take care of my mother full time, and I withdrew from the study. I thought that I had done that a long time ago. Um, but you kept sending me the applications. I no longer I I said I no longer had time to be part of the study. And, um, anyway, my life changed. I don't have time for it. I don't have the interest in it. Um, my husband died very suddenly and and he had been seeing it was his second out of cancer. And, um, anyway, I do not want to be part of the study. Thank you."
"So this was a cancer prevention study, and I actually got cancer, so I just kinda quit."
Stanley is deceased. Please stop calling.
That's too much work. I too much busy work. I'm too old. I can't. I can't focus on that.
"The main reason is because, um, of covid and the problems that it's created along with, um, I have a new grand baby that is living with me that was born. So I'm sorry. If you'd like to send them again, I'd be happy to complete it. Thank you."
"The questions were so detailed that and after I had done them the first time, I I just got tired of answering all those questions each time."
"The reason I did not complete them is they asked, too personal of questions like how many sex partners I had, and I did not want to answer that. That is nobody's business."
The surveys are too long and I don't have enough time to sit there and complete them off. That's why I haven't completed them.
"There was one survey that I didn't seem to have time to complete. And if you sent me some through email, I don't check my email on a routine basis. I probably didn't know that there were any. If you mail them to me, I'll try to make time for them. But I don't check my email regularly. Sorry."
"There were a number of questions about sexual activity that I felt very uncomfortable, how they related to this study and was very displeased. Period. I no longer wish to participate, period."
There's really no particular reason why I would just get them and and just forget to complete them.
"There's too many questions, too time conserving. All the answers are the same. From the first time that I answered all these questions, it's the same."
"They just got lost in my email, but I'd like to do it now. It's not too late."
"They just got lost in the shuffle of, uh, day to day living in priorities and forget on this."
"They were just too lengthy. Too personal. I don't know, just didn't do it."
They were very extensive and repetitive and and a bit time consuming.
They're too long and I haven't had time to do it. Then it's to help him.
"They're too long, too wordy."
They're way too detailed. They take way too much time. What? What do you watch? Okay.
"This is Mrs Donald Davidson. Donald Davidson passed away in 2014. I sent a copy of his death certificate to, uh, Atlanta. When I received the information. The packets. I was one of the volunteers that ran and operated C. P s three here in Victoria, Texas. The very first one in the country. Donald Davidson was the very first person to get his blood drawn in the country. And I did send the death certificate into Atlanta to, uh, to I forget an alpha or whatever her name is. I forget now, but anyhow, uh, my name is Kathleen Davidson, and I should be on record. Me and um Ah. Oh, I forget her name now. And you have the two of us ran and scheduled and operated the first C. P. S three study here in Victoria. Ah, I've been trying trying to contact somebody Alpha. Anyhow, Nancy and I had actually gone to Atlanta for take classes and stuff, so I know all about the A. C. P s. And I would like someone from there to call me so I can explain what happened to Donald. Ah, you've got the number, and please have somebody called me from the C. P. S. I appreciate it. Thank you."
"This is just bizarre. Let me take down the information. What was your What did you say your name was? Mhm. I'm I'm gonna figure it out. Just I don't know what's going on with this is this isn't right. I know it's fine. Just don't Don't let don't let Derek know. Please. Okay. You're okay. Can you spell your name, please? Where did you say you were calling from? Now, I need to know exactly where you got this number. That nobody should be calling into this line. And it's actually we're We're tracing the call right now, so I'm gonna have your exact location, but I want to know your business practices and exactly what's going on over there in your office."
"Usually I start to intend to to complete them. And then there's just so much I'm going on with with work that I that I don't get to them and I just run out, and I just don't have put the time into to completing them."
We thought we did.
"Well, I for one, for one reason, uh, the the surveys were were too lengthy. They were, uh it was just mammoth to complete them. And so, uh, you know, I would try to get into it. You know, I wouldn't have time. Uh, and so it was just too difficult. Uh, I'm used to a lot of paperwork, but it it's it's just too much. Um, so I think I discarded them."
"Well, I really wanted to participate, but, um, it was just asking too many detailed questions that I've you know, how much I ate on a, um, different things. It was It was just, um I guess I should have said time, but, um, I'm sorry that I did not participate. Uh, if there's something I can do to help, please, let me know. Thank you. Yeah."
"Well, I thought I was past the age of doing it. I am now 74. I'm sorry, 73."
"Well, I was diagnosed with, uh, most of my normal six months ago, and I just haven't I don't have time for that right now. Bye."
"Well, number one I don't have cancer. I've never had cancer, and I'm not sure how I got involved in this project."
"Well, you don't meet all the polls, huh? Because my life has happened. Well, my son died in two thousand seventeen. My mom died. My dad gave me Coby status. Well, a little bit, right? At high and low in life and and I stopped filling it. Do you want them? I let her pass."
What do you have to say?
"When I first met with your representatives, I specifically asked if my personal information would be used, that they were taking that day and how it would be used, and they assured me that everything would be anonymous. So I provided information. And next thing you know, I'm getting things in the mail that have my name, date of birth and other very personal information in the mail. I did not sign up for that. It didn't appreciate it. It's not what I planned on doing."
"When I got the first one, I was very taken back by the level of detail. Uh, that was that. I was expected to recall about my dietary habits when I was a child. Um, I found that to be very unreliable information, and it was very lengthy, so I did not want to take the time to try and agonize over questions. How many hot dogs did you eat A week as a child? I have no idea. Uh, I'm in my early sixties now. I have no idea. And those kinds of questions were just a big turn off to me, and I felt that it was not going to be reliable information."
"When I initially signed up for the, uh, surveys, I was told that I was not eligible. I would have to go elsewhere to take the survey, and no one followed up with me on that. Therefore, I did not, uh I was no longer part of the, uh, study."
"When I'm asked about how much time I spend in the sun or exercise, I have a hard time evaluating those questions, and I don't wanna give inaccurate information."
Who are you? Why are you calling me? How did you get my name? Yeah.
"Yeah, okay, answer two previous polls. This past year's got lost to me. Okay, yeah, you can send me the one again."
Yeah.
Yeah. I didn't notice that they came to me or not. I'm not certain that I got them.
"Yeah. Oh, no. What I get Wait till I get off the phone."
"Yeah. So I talked to someone, um, from your organization, and I needed an electronic version to make it easier. Um, but they weren't able to divide that for me, and I got frustrated and gave up with the process."
"Yeah. Then on my list, I at least every month that in a million vet, um, survey. But I should be doing and I see it. So I put it down and it gets buried, And then I put it back on the list and, um, actually got something recently from you, and I'd be glad to connect. I just need to do it."
"Yeah. We moved to England and have not been receiving them. We are returning us next month, Would to you."
"Yes, I have been having a lot of health problems, which has made it hard for me to complete them. Plus, I was in. I had my leg amputated. I was in a nursing home for over 10 months."
"Yes, sorry and lazy."
a change of direction.
"a combination of all. I lost some. I forgot about some, and then I had missed some. So then I didn't know if I should start back up, cause I feel like I should just start over or something. Um, cause I've missed so many so many of the the studies. So then when I got the next one, I mean so many of the questionnaire. So when I got the next one, I thought, Oh, I never filled out the last one. So then I didn't fill out the next one."
"a lot of the information that was asked. I wasn't 100% sure by memory of the accuracy. So, um, I didn't want to give information that was not 100% accurate."
address change and did not receive surveys that new address.
"after originally signing up, I failed to do a good job of keeping track of all the data that was required, period. So by filling out the survey, I figured it would not be accurate, period. Therefore, no benefit, period. Okay, okay."
"alright, multifactorial requires too much personal information."
and I simply didn't have the time to complete them.
"are you like? Are you okay with us picking dunk, Aruz like, do you have any, like, like push back against that?"
"are you like? Are you okay with us picking like Do you have any, like, like push back against that?"
"as well as I can remember, it was because they asked the same information repeatedly in each survey, and it felt like I was wasting my time, and it asked a lot of information that had no relevance to what my personal information would provide."
"back when I was initially, uh, trying to get into the program, I spoke with my doctor who advised me not to enter into the program because she would not okay me not taken certain of my medications. And I thought I communicated that back with you. All I sent I sent something back saying that I was not in the program."
"because I actually was diagnosed with cancer and went to breast cancer surgery, chemo and radiation at the same time. We moved, and I never got the following surveys."
because I am retired and I have too many other things going on in my life. I just I don't have time to do it anymore.
because I could not read the password you put on the envelope. I cannot see and I cannot read printed material most of the time.
because I didn't want to do it anymore.
because I got cancer and I didn't think I still needed to be in your survey.
because I had a kidney transplant and I've been going back and forth to Piedmont Hospital in Atlantic treatment.
"because I have a disability that affects my hand function, and filling out that much paperwork is extremely painful. I was told that there would be some option other than having to write them out by hand, but that has not happened."
because I have not gotten paid for them.
because I moved and I'm not receiving them.
"because I moved, my address changed and I never got them."
because I never signed up to take it.
because I think they're stupid.
because I thought. Well I think it is not necessary to fill the because I have no condition that you want to fill the
because I want to get out of your list. Do not
because I was a patient of cancer and life got busy.
"because I would get a survey and I would refill out one, and then I'd get another one, and then I'd forget."
because I'm not interested. And I would like you to take my phone number off your database. Thank you. Goodbye.
"because I've been very sick and going through a divorce and have been very depressed and disorganized and have to pack and move, and I kept losing them."
because Kendra had had this phone in over three years. That's why this is not his phone number.
because donations don't go to the patients. It goes to your C E. O s.
because it changes direction. Maybe.
"because it's these three questions are demonstrating for me to act accurately answer the surveys. None of the questions. None of the answers, the forced choice answers fit fit me being honest. So that's why, after I struggled through the first one, I just started the second one that said, This is ridiculous. I'm being forced to make choices that that doesn't even accurate for me, So I stopped doing it."
"because most of the questions are repeat of the first thing I answered, and it doesn't seem appropriate to keep answering the same questions over and over again."
"because on the phone, instead of it coming up the American Cancer Society, it comes up spam and bright orange, so I don't answer spam calls."
because the survey questions dating back to when you were a little kid. I just hadn't no answer. I thought it would falsify the results of the ah study.
"because they repeat questions. And I couldn't remember dates from way back when. And it just was a constant repeat of the same questions about my female health and all these things that I couldn't remember the the dates of the time stuff even fill it out and become very frustrating. It wasn't just a simple like ask if there was changes. You you were continued to ask dates and I couldn't remember, and I probably sent them back in with different dates on in the beginning, and then I just thought I got exasperated with it and quit."
because they were too extensive and I'm really gonna eh get tired.
"because they're overwhelming. They take hours to complete, and I don't remember what I've eaten for a whole year. It's ridiculous. I did it twice and it was unbelievably hard and I just couldn't. I couldn't bring myself to open the envelope. After that, it was just too much."
"because you asked so many questions that I did not have answers to. I didn't have any way to recollect the information you're requiring. And, um, it had been probably 10 years since I signed up for that. So you didn't say that there was gonna be that many questions I have to know over the 10 year span. Sorry."
"because you don't seem to want to protect the privacy of my information. I've talked to you guys twice, and both times you have acknowledged that you have no responsibility what third parties do with the information. I don't agree with that policy, so I stopped participating."
"because, um, a few years ago, when, um, they were taking my blood work, they weren't able to take the blood work. So then I was able to not be a full participant in the study. So because I wasn't able to be in the study fully because, um, the, um I couldn't take my blood work. I didn't really feel like I would get the full, uh, benefit of being in the study, because, um, it it it it wasn't as valid."
"bizarre. Let me take down the information. What was your What did you say your name was? Mhm. I'm I'm gonna figure it out. Just don't know what's going on with this is this isn't right. I know it's fine. Just don't Don't let don't let Derek know. Please. Okay. You're okay. Can you spell your name, please? Where did you say you were calling from? Now, I need to know exactly where you got this number. That nobody should be calling into this line. And it's actually we're We're tracing the call right now, so I'm gonna have your exact location, but I want to know your business practices and exactly what's going on over there in your office."

"during the study. Enrollment? Um, I was I was not sure if my sample was still, uh, capped. And if I was still included in the study and there was no follow up phone call at that time hand side did not complete the following service."
"easier to do stuff online or over the phone than it is on paper. And then when I get it in the mail, I just forget about it. It'd be easier if a link was sent through an email or something like this over the phone."
"every time I got them. They were very long, a lot of questions, and I didn't have time to do it."
find it is written in English and I don't really know the language.
"five years ago, I broke my steamer and my husband had to help me. Re re, um you know, we live, We learn to live, do everything. And after that, we had a hurricane and a tornado, and recently my husband passed away and my really my last been a nightmare for this coming to an end. So that's why and I apologize, but it was nothing I could do."
forgot to complete survey and relocated to another state.
"forgot, and then I would get lazy and forget to do them."
"freaking hot air balloon. I'm gonna lose reception here. I should probably call the cops or something. What are they gonna do about it? Who are you gonna notify? What?

"if this is regarding the D E s. Um, long time ago in 1951 I was part of a control group. My mom did not receive that. So at a certain point, after all these years, I just felt like it wasn't relevant."
if you didn't Alright Survey.
if you know me. And you know all these surveys went through. I need to know why you're still asking me if I'm having Children. When I went through menopause and questions that should have been already recorded on all the surveys I sent in.
"in 2000 and 15, my husband, David Burke, was diagnosed with colon cancer. He fall colon cancer for five years. Uh, and I just I lost him several months ago."
"in some ways, um, the questions were it was too hard to pin down. What? How often? I did a certain thing or didn't do a certain thing. Um, in other ways, it was too broad. You know it. I just didn't know. I was very frustrating because I didn't know how to answer the half the questions, and some of them didn't even apply. So I just got It was very feudal and I gave up."
irresponsible. It's extremely law irresponsible.
"it is related to time, but the surveys are long and we just did not have time to fill the long surveys out."
"it kind of falls under time, but I would call it more laziness."
it takes a long time.
"it was Answer choice number two and answer Choice number three times sometimes and sometimes forget to do them. Um, it's been a little challenging. Just life. Go on life reasons. So that's the, um, the reason, but I am still interested."
"it was asking questions I couldn't answer. Like what? All prescriptions I've been on when and for how long and dosage. And, um, I really don't have a record. I've lived different places, and even after I lived here, it's like every year there would be a different doctor, so"
"it was way too complicated. It wanted to rely on my memory, which is who can remember what happened 10, 15, 20 years ago."
it would be good if they were offered online instead of paper. I only remember receiving paper version.
"it's possible that I forgot to complete some, but I thought I had also submitted some of the responses so would want someone to make sure that they have received the responses that I did submit."
it's too complicated and too time consuming.
it's too long.
just decided not to participate any longer.
"just family life, Uh, different priorities coming up. And, um, they were just put on the back burner and then forgotten."
just hasn't been a focus.
"just just plain laziness pushed him aside and and, uh, don't, uh, put much stock in it."
"just lack of time with other things that, uh, priorities in my life. I just, uh there's a lot of detail questions that took research and didn't have the time to dig in to get that detail, to be able to answer the question correctly."

just seems like a lot of time involved. Yeah.
just too difficult to fill out.

"my address changed and the survey started getting a little too in detail of information, and I didn't feel comfortable answering that."
my address has changed.
"my address has changed. I didn't receive it. So, um yeah, I need to I need to update my address, so I'm not really sure how I do that, but, um, that is, uh, basically, what's going on? I I didn't get it because of my address. Has changed, and and actually, my address is about to change again in a in about a month's time. So, um yeah, I guess if there's if you could email me or email me can't mail me. If the address you can email me away from you to update my address, I'd appreciate it. Thank you."
my answer to the question does not apply.
"my health is not good. I'm constantly sick. I've had a lot of viral issues as well as coveted, so I'm not participating anymore, period."

"not long after I started the program, I got kidney cancer and I didn't feel that It was very important for me to continue prevention if, uh, I it already occurred."
okay about an order or something?
okay. Worried about confidentiality and the time to take.
"on occasion, I had to look up information and I never went back and finished it."
"on the initial blood draw. They were not able to draw my blood, so I did not think I was a part of the study. Mm."
"one I had done and filled it all out. And my son had spilt coffee over the whole thing, and it was soaking wet. And the one before that it had just gotten misplaced because I had moved and any other I only remember the two."
"one of the the first survey that I got. I tried to access it online, and for whatever reason, my code wasn't working. And so I called. Um, they told me someone told me to wait, um, and try it again. And I never could access it. I got another a survey and tried to do the same thing. I never could access it."
one reason I forgot another reason I moved.
"one reason is they are so in depth, and I have a problem with my memory as far as remembering. You know what? I've eight, how many times I've eaten it or how many times I've done something else. It's just very confusing for me. Plus, my husband, uh, he's been going through chemo and radiation. He has also been, uh, diagnosed with cancer."
opt out.

"our home burned in the campfire. We've been displaced, homeless. I haven't had a whole lot of time or energy to do much of anything."
out of town.
overwhelmed.
"paper is stupid, and doing things on regular mail is ancient. You need to do this online."
paper surveys are very difficult to complete. Keep organized and remember to do. The surveys are long and complicated and easy to put in a stack and misplace.
"part of it was time, and part of it was not wanting to reveal personal information, not knowing where it would go."
"partly was time. There was 2.5 years. I was working over 100 hours a week. Um, and there were also a couple of surveys I completed, But by the time I got around to mailing them, I honestly thought it was too late to mail them, so I didn't. I ended up tossing them after a few months."
password issues.
personal life crisis.
personal reasons.
please remove me from the study.
please resend the survey.
probably.
"putting down my, um, food choices. The diet was too time consuming and complicated."
"questions, asked too much detail of past history that I don't remember, got frustrated and stopped."
really. It just takes too long. It takes too long. Too many questions that I really can't answer on. 72 years old going on 73. And it just too many questions on there. Mhm.
"receiving mail copies is no longer, uh, a good option for me. Uh, most of the mail is trash that comes to this residence. Uh, I prefer to complete maybe something. A survey on, uh, electronically on our website. And I feel like the study should have modernised with the times right now and established for its volunteers an account online where things are a little bit more transparent. We see what's going in. What's going out. I just do not like the mail survey, old style."
redundancy. Nothing's changed. Too much information.
"repeat of old, consistent repeat of old questions. So answering the same questions over and over and over again, Um, I just got tired of answering the same question over and over again, Um, instead of the new information you know, in the past year, in the past two years since I filled it out last, um, filling up the same information over and over and over again isn't gonna provide you any new information. Um, and that's why"
"right now. Right? So we pass my Edgar. Hey, goodbye. I don't see you tomorrow, So anyway, so the new room it's about Do you believe in, like, do you believe we're the only one in universe? Because I don't. I think it's so many Galaxies, is it? You know, the it should be more lives, you know? So okay, so this new room, right, that I'm cleaning right now it's all about all about the Jupiter Mars Saturn sun. So my favorite one, is it you picture? Hold on. That's the thing. When you say Jupiter, nothing happened. But when you get closer to that money can, you know, manic un so closer to American and you say you Yeah. Can you hear it? Hold on. You you You do do do do do. I'm freaking out. Yeah, well, anyway, so I I'm so excited to see about your proposition. So come on. So I'm sorry. My mouth, I'm I feel like I'm a freaking, like, being lonely all my life until you call. Look, hole. Yeah. Hello. I'm so sorry for interrupting you. I've got to the new to this room, and I always, you know, like I always wanted to do this. Always wanted to. This. I'm going to do something. Just doesn't judge me. Can you hear them? It's my leg beam is my Pachulia. He always gave me double burrito, so I paid for 50%. You know, like only half free. I pay half. He gave me half free because like he's a cool, cool dude hold. And every single time he's gonna give me some stuff for free. Hold on, It's coming again. Don't worry about it. I'm sorry. Kind of like No. Sorry. But anyways, every single time when I get my breath for free, I will say mhm."
security concerns.
"sending back mails forms is difficult. An email with a website to put this information in would be much more convenient and less lucky for me to forget. And also, I would have it with me. And I could do it if I had a few minutes while I was waiting on someone so it would be more convenient. Um, I guess that's it. Thank you."
"seven years ago, I was diagnosed with cancer."
she change of address?
"shortly after I initially signed up for the surveys, my mother passed from ovarian cancer, and I was not comfortable at that time completing surveys."
shortly after signing up to be a part of the study. I was diagnosed with cancer and did not feel like I was a candidate anymore to participate in the study.
"show, Uh, more so time, Um, like a position. You know, the family and social plugs. Um, Okay, precious. You are completely grossing what we're doing."
sickness.
"so I think it's a combination of I'm not sure if I've received all the surveys and, um maybe forgetting. Um, but I would be happy if you sent me a survey to fill it out at this point. Thank you."
so it was mostly completed and then I felt like it was too late.
"so much of the information on all of the surveys is repetitive, and it is so hard to go back and, you know, go back through your history even as to when you were a teenager. And all of that was filled out at least once or twice on the original surveys, and to have to repeat those same questions over and over again. Seems to me it just is is just very difficult."
"so over the years when I've gotten those surveys initially, I wanted to go online to complete them, and then after amount of time, a certain amount of time lapse and I forgot to go online to do it, Then I would misplace the paperwork with, like the, you know, log in credentials or, you know, code or what have you. And then I would try to do the written version, and then I would misplace the written version. So if someone could reach out to me, um, and let me know how I can, you know, get back into the mix and get that done. That would be outstanding. I can be reached at 616915 2716 if someone could personally reach out to me or my email address Ray Marshall, 59 at gmail dot com R A y m A R S H A L l 59 at gmail dot com Thank you"
"some of the questions went back as far as 40 years, and I could not remember. It seems to me it was about my pregnancies or something like that, and I could not recall. So I thought, rather than give you information, that might not be true. I just decided to just continue my, uh, participation in the surveys. Thank you."
some of the survey questions were more intimate or invasive than I would have liked to have answered.
"some of the surveys asked personal questions much more personal than I care to, um, to send in."
"sorry. I just got lazy. Each time I came in, I thought, I'm going to complete them. But they are time consuming. And after a while, I just never bothered. Completed, and I still have them. I've never thrown them away. Always intended it to to do them. But of course I haven't. So I guess the only answer is laziness. Sorry about that."
started a new job been in and out of town. I haven't had the time.
sure it was completed and we emailed.
survey was completed incent.
"survey. Lengthy, too detailed requires records that I no longer have."
"surveys are very lengthy, and it would be beneficial to see something more sustain CTE that can be quickly populated."
surveys too long.
surveys were completed and returned in the envelope in which they were address back.
"surveys were only about my behaviors. Never, ever did I get a survey that actually question my current health, whether I had cancer when I was being treated for cancer or anything, it was just a repetitive sociological experiment asking about my behaviors."
"the amount of time I've needed to complete It was more than I was expecting. I started working on one of the surveys, and I still have about four pages left to complete."
"the history from when I was young, it was very detailed and I do not remember accurately what I put on the first survey, so I don't want to submit false information."
the last one I did was too long and complicated.
"the last. The last survey I received in 2015 was when I was having meningitis and having to have brain surgery myself. So to fix the whole of my soul, So I didn't have time to do it or the mindset to read it. I haven't received any others after that point."
"the process were filled out, the forum was too lengthy, and I, uh, never dedicated the time to do it."
"the question was were repetitive, and some of them were. I just didn't have answers, for it's been some of the questions were just so long ago that I couldn't even remember answers for."
the questions are repetitive.
"the questions were very vague, and we're asking me to recall how much weight I have lost. I was in my teens, and it didn't seem very, um, accurate for me to be recalling something from 30 years ago."
"the right person. I got it sometimes, you know? Yeah, it's it's a mess. Just reaching that is a new technologies, you know, we're using, like, um, um, batteries. And now we had formed. And sometimes when the batteries, uh, like getting low, you know, like it starts crossing the line back and forth, back and forth. But I got it. I got it. Hold on one second. I'm gonna transfer. Transfer you to the right person. Okay. Thank you for your patience. Stay on the line to continue in English, please. Press 18 Thank you for calling. How can I help you? Hey. Ah, Didn't I just Did I just talk to you?"
"the survey is, uh, fairly lengthy and unfortunately with, uh, family and work, Um, I just haven't had the opportunity to sit down in a block of time to answer all the different questions."
the survey looked too long to be completed in shorter time.
the survey questionnaire was just too lengthy for me to take the time to complete it. There was just too many questions and it was overwhelming.
"the survey seemed redundant and asking questions about exercise and how much How many minutes and, uh, I ended buried from week to week, so it was really hard to come up with a a true answer."
"the surveys I remember receiving and looking at were asking for specific information. Um, from the medical record that I did not have available, Um"
"the surveys are a bit complicated, um, asking for specific information that is difficult to recall, uh, and and, um, and just quite involved and take up a fair amount of time."
the surveys are just much too long.
the surveys are just to long to fill out too timely.
"the surveys are so detailed and ask so many specific questions that I don't feel able to give you the exact answers for all of the tons of questions you were answering asking. So, uh, so I haven't filled it out. Um"
the surveys are too long. They need to be short. And I don't have that much time. I am working full time over the course of years and now I am working as a disaster worker with the covet unit. I don't have time for these long surveys there. Too long. You gotta find a way to shorten them.
"the surveys came, I wasn't able to do them online, so I there was always a problem with getting on, so I just stopped trying."
"the surveys did seem to take a lot of time, but I did one day sit down at the computer and link to try to do it online, and I was told it was no longer supported, so I couldn't do it. But if you send it to me again, I'll make the effort to do it."
"the surveys just take too long, period."
the surveys seems to be quite long and time consuming.
"the surveys were extremely long. If there were a shorter and to the point, I would be more than glad to fill them out, it just didn't have time to sit down and do it."
"the surveys were too lengthy and tedious. Um, and I I would wish I had."
"the surveys were too wordy, too lengthy, and I just felt that I didn't have any health issues and I wasn't a good candidate to be part of it, so I decided not to fill them out anymore."
"the surveys were very difficult to answer with the lifestyle I have. I work two jobs and they were asking about something about walking how many steps, Um, the choices were very confusing, and I had to spend way too much time thinking about those type of details in my day, when every day look different for me."
"the surveys were way too long. Page after page after page of the same questions, that's just a different way."
the time just got away and it was too late to send them in. And now I must have been received anymore.
"the, um, survey. The first follow up survey was too, uh detailed, and I could not remember well enough to answer certain aspects of it. And then, um, it seemed as though I should not, uh, do the follow up surveys since I hadn't returned the first one."
there are other things going on in my life.
there are too many questions and it's time consuming and I don't want to do it.
"there was a delay in receiving the information. And after the delay, I really didn't even realize that we were in the system, so I never completed it cause I lost interest."
"there was some information I didn't know all of the answers to, And then I just never completed it because I wasn't sure of what my for, for example, what? My weight was on different days because, uh, you know, different years, it's gone up and down. So I didn't understand what the point of repetitive questions were because I've already answered up to a certain point, so that's why I didn't finish it."
there's too many questions asking the same thing.
they are just too time consuming way too much information to collect each time.
they are too invasive.
they are too long.
they are very long.
they became overwhelming. I have attention deficit and I also have learning disabilities. I started everyone and never could complete them.
they became too invasive. There were too many questions that I did not want to answer.
they came via U. S mail and I have to fill out the paperwork period. It would be better if they were sent via email so I can complete online.
they just take a lot of they take too long.
they seemed too long and invasive.
"they take a very long time. So maybe that is time. But, um, they're long, and I understand they need a lot of information, but maybe if they were, um, shorter, more frequent, that could give you the answers that you need that will make it more beneficial for me to answer."
"they were in paper, they had to be mailed. It's a time to do that manually. At home. It's much easier and quicker if they could come to me. The, uh easy 123 emails. Um, simplified."
they were paper based and they required too much time.
"they were so detailed. I didn't even always know the answers to the questions, and I just didn't take the time then it's partly time and partly because they were just so detailed and long."
"they were too complicated. I tried to complete the first one on computer and I had a question that I didn't know the answer to. I wanted to skip over that and move on, but I wasn't able to go back."
"they were too in depth and too long to complete, um, and needing to find information that I didn't have readily available."
they were too long.
"they were very long and I would put them aside, and then I guess I would forget."
they're just very lengthy and repetitive.
they're too lengthy.
they're too long and too confusing for me to fill out.
they're too long.
things from cancer deal and I forgot to do it. I forgot to send in. The survey survey was very long.

"time in fact, was an issue, but also it's so very personal."
"time was one aspect inconvenience, and I did complete one and send it in. Um, but apparently you all didn't get it or something. I don't know, but they are pretty lengthy, and I have taken the time to do them, but I don't think you've always gotten them."
"time was one issue, but also, um uh, it none of it was relevant and, uh, to me at that time, and I just really didn't have time to deal with it. It would be easier if I got received it online."
"time, I do not have the time to fill out the survey."

What were you saying?"
too invasive.
too long.
too many questions.
two personal questions.
two. Not enough time. Too busy.
"uh, I didn't complete the surveys because I got, like, two or three surveys within several weeks of each other. So I was just kind of frustrated because, uh, it was the same questionnaire, and I had mailed it in, and then I got another one, like, within a week or two. And it was the same exact thing, so I didn't I think we're gonna get them that often."
"uh, I meant to say time. Um, but I am expecting to be able to complete the survey that comes out in this coming year."
"uh, I moved, um, out of state. And, um well, several states, uh, I have been, um, incapacitated. Taking care of family members who are ill and deceased now, and I just haven't had time. Um, and my son was injured. I didn't have time to do any of it."
"uh, I suspect I moved a couple of years ago, and they probably didn't get forwarded to my new address. Um, so I'll see if I can find them or find a way to get my new address on your website."
"uh, I was just way too complicated. And I'm not good at keeping track of all those different things, even for myself, so I haven't been able to do them."
"uh, all the above probably postponed them, but I did complete some and send them back. Assume you would have gotten them."
"uh, based on my research of confidentiality, uh, by the American Cancer Society. I understand that, um, my confidentiality isn't fully protected."
"uh, have gotten married since the survey started. And the last name is now Hahn calmer. H a n k a M M E r. And I'm living in, um 3 28 Harvest Street. Uh, middle start, Illinois 62260"
"uh, it's hard to say exactly. I think I was busy and I put them aside. And then time went by and I thought, Oh, you know, they have other people. I'm not that important in the survey, and I just And then after I hadn't answered the survey for a couple of times, I thought, Well, you know, they can't use my information because I didn't fill out the surveys before, so that's kinda It's not one thing it's, I don't know. I got behind And then I figured, Oh, my information wasn't gonna be helpful because I skipped some of the surveys."
"uh, just a plain. I guess. It's a combination of other things. Uh, my life has become quite static. And, uh, health of my, uh, traveling had to take president or anything, honestly, so I just have not had the time to do it."
"uh, multiple copies received. Started filling them out. Uh, life change between job and home. Uh, never got back to it. Got file notification. Thought I missed the window. Uh, I am still interested, complete."
"uh, other thing. You took priority."
"uh, several job changes. Uh, marriage, uh, wife with a stroke. Uh, keep me a little busy."
"uh, the"
"uh, the last time I went to do the survey I had was over the age that I should fill it out, so it was too old."
"uh, the surveys are no longer valid. Uh, I didn't realize it was many surveys over the years. You can take me off your list. Thank you."
"uh, there was a death in the family, and then after that, I I just forgot."
"uh, two lengthy, uh, two repetitions, uh, questions."
"uh, we moved and never received them."
"uh, we moved from the area and also just kinda lost interest in following up my nose."
"uh, you people, uh, would spend as much time and money, uh, for your, uh, cause instead of, uh, harassing people and, uh, just, uh, basically begging for money. You get a hell of a lot more done. American public is really sick and tired of all the political games that everyone wants to play. So in, uh, your best interest. Don't call here again."
"um I assumed that they were the same survey, and the first one I got had questions that I didn't know how to answer about parenting. I don't know much about my father, so I didn't answer."
"um I attempted to complete, um, a few of the surveys you guys sent. Uh, they were, and I've always run out of time and trying to get, you know, other things done. I am a working mom, and as such, uh, I have a pretty long list every day of things I need to complete. I'm very interested in continuing my, uh, participation in the study. And I'd like to know if they're the other, uh, speedy ways that still surveys could be completed. And if there's anything I can do to make up any information that you guys are missing from me from the past years"
"um I believe I completed one or two of the surveys, but we moved in September, actually moved in June of 2000 and 19 again and then again in September of 2000 and 19. So I don't know when you mailed the last ones out, but, uh, I feel like I've completed one or two of them over the years, but I have not received anything in the last, uh, year and a half or two years."
um I did complete it and send it back.
"um I have moved twice in the last three years, and I'm pretty sure I stopped receiving them."
"um I moved, but only sort of. I moved to go to graduate school, so I still get on my mail at home. But when I'm home, I haven't had the time to fill out the surveys. Um, I've seen them and just not gone to them. My apologies."
"um I save them to thinking I would have more time to complete them, and I just never got around to it, and then I missed the deadline."
"um I thought I received something that said I was no longer in the study and I thought I was getting them an error. I would like to participate. No. If that's not the case, please let me know if I can still participate."
"um I thought the surveys were long and they were repetitive. It was, uh, things that I had answered the first time I filled out the survey. So I think eventually I just, uh quit filling them out."
"um I want to, but they make me feel anxious and sad."
"um I was moving, but I would be glad to complete them now."
"um I'm legally blind, and so paperwork is sort of hard for me to do. Um, I actually have, uh I don't know where they are, but they're somewhere in my house. Um, if you email me the service, maybe I could do it."
um I'm no longer interested in participating in the study.
"um I'm not feeling well. I have a severe migraine issue and an an auto immune disease, and I just, um I'm not feeling well."
"um I've heard stories from people regarding the American Cancer Society that they do not follow up on there, um, promises to help people that, um, are currently dealing with the disease."
"um Well, I retired, relocated. And, uh, that was just one of the things I never did get done."
um just didn't want to take the time to complete them.
um out of the country.
um we have moved and I didn't receive them at the new with us.
"um well, I'm a little embarrassed to say I would kind of put them away and think I was gonna get to it, and then I didn't get to it, and so I I just didn't. But I If if you want to send one, um, I would definitely try to, um, fill it out, if I can. For the lapse. In between there, I did have some medical issues, not any of it. Cancer related, And then I just kind of got family busy with family stuff. And, um, yeah, I really don't have an excuse, so I am sorry, but, um, yeah, I'm not having any cancer issues at all."
"um, I I may have I don't I I don't remember whether I did or not. Um, I know one of the issues I have, and I want to help. I've supported cancer for many years, but I haven't been able to, uh, more recently, I'm having some financial, some financial problems, but, uh uh, So I don't know why I didn't exactly sure why I didn't complete the survey, but, uh uh, I'd be happy to complete them in the future."
"um, I believe I completed them. I'm not sure why I'm getting this call stating that I didn't. So, um, I know recently there wasn't any. I haven't seen anything on my way. Um, but I know in the past year, I've completed something, so I'm a little bit"
"um, I can do them again. Uh, it has been very busy. Uh, my husband had a kidney transplant. Things are starting to return to normal. I could fill out forms if you need them."
"um, I didn't know I would have to complete so many, but I've been down, um, having back surgery, and it's hard for me to sit for any length of time. And I've been recovering for 19 months and I have another back surgery coming up."
"um, I don't like filling out surveys and some of the questions I did not know the answers to."
"um, I guess I just, uh I kept putting it off and just never got it done, and probably too late or whatever, so that's my only reason."
"um, I'm depressed. Depression gets in the way of my getting a lot of things done. Your cancer survey is one of those things. If you wanna send it to me again, I'll fill it out."
"um, I've I've been a patient at MD. Anderson. Um, I have"
"um, Mr. White had passed away."
"um, at the time, I wasn't, um, interested. But I am now."
"um, misplaced a different location relocation."
until 2020. I have not been to the doctor. Yeah.
"very depressed because I had cancer and I had to have a full hysterectomy. I have no family, no brothers and sisters, parents, kids, husband. Nobody. I was completely by myself. And so I just didn't want anything that reminded me of anything of cancer because I was fighting it. Um, I've been in remission for two years and I'm doing better since I got the hysterectomy, but I just didn't want to see anything with the word cancer on it."
we have moved several times and no surveys have followed.
we moved and didn't receive it.
"we moved out of state and I never got them, and I forgot about it."
"we received them and then forgot to to, uh, fill them out."
"well, they seem rather long, and I really don't keep track of my time that well, So I feel like I'm I'm inadequate to fill out the questions. I I worry about them being accurate. That's why I haven't done it."
"what? No beep. Uh, first of all, you guys please feel free to call me in person. I do not care for speaking with automated systems at all. This is Phyllis Harker, who is very much willing to continue participation. Phone number 77342082652 years ago, I went through, um, some very, uh, traumatic and dramatic circumstances. And, uh, I It was a combination of me forgetting and me not having time available and then forgetting again. I do apologize. You guys. Thank you so much."
"when I got them, I just didn't sit down and take the time to do the survey. Um, I I guess I thought it was just gonna be less work when I signed up to do it the first time."
"when I received the survey, it would be not at a good time and the survey is way too long. Way too long. It's way too long, so I would start it and then I'd have to do work and just not complete it and forget too long, and then I would forget to do it."
"when I went for the initial screening, Uh, the, uh, so called nurses that were taking blood. I had three attempts to draw blood and could not do it. I regularly have blood tests a couple of times a year with no problem. Uh, but I have to being stuck with a needle three times, which is something I don't appreciate. Anyway, um, I had to give up and not being able to participate fully. I don't feel any value in doing anything, uh, in the study, Um, and I I feel strongly about fighting cancer, having lost both parents to cancer, But, um, I was upset that I was not fully able to, uh, participate because of the inadequacy of the people drawing blood."
"when the surveys come in the mail. I seems like I'm always in the middle of something crazy, busy, and then I don't get it done, and then by the time I get back to it, I assume that it's too late."
who change of address.
"with family responsibilities, job situations. It's not high on my priority list."
with identity theft going around. I don't sell anything out online or in the mail.
"within the first one or two evaluations or surveys, I was diagnosed with cancer."
"work and family. Very busy. Well, let me do my blood and everything."
working lots of overtime.
would be better electronic.
"years ago. When I came in for the study, they were not able to draw blood, so it was a mood point. As far as I was concerned, I don't want to receive the surveys. I was never tested, and I'd like you to stop calling me."
