And I think a lot could be done to have more communication, either by a telephone such as this, via text message or email that keeps people updated on the progress of the survey, the importance of the survey and that they will be contacted periodically for additional information and that let them know what the schedule of those contacts and reach out would be. Maybe they even are provided a login ID and password and a reminder so that they could go online, log in themselves and complete the information that's required so that it would say that not everything had to be hand filled out. Um, I just think technology of all kinds could be better leveraged to, um, reach out to people.

I needed to have things easy when it comes to the Internet and doing online stuff such as the survey. And when I became hung up, I I don't have time to try to investigate how to move on now. Maybe that's been corrected since I last completed a survey, but I don't need to have any other questions answered. I just needed to have completion of that survey, be very easy to access and to complete. And maybe that has happened since I dropped out years ago. And I do everything using my phone. At the time that I last completed a survey, I was at work on a work, a full screen work computer, and, uh, that's when I last completed, um, a survey and then a subsequent survey I attempted to complete. I ran into problems and and now I'm at home retired. I don't have a full screen computer. I just have my cell phone, and I do do everything by my cell phone. I do a lot of shopping by my cell phone. I do all of my taxes and my son's taxes year after year, using my cell phone. Um, so I use my cell phone more than anything. And so, uh, wondering if you can have a phone application?
